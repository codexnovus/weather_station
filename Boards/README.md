# About the boards

The shield board is designed to be a cheap way of getting the kit ready. All components are cheap, easy to find, and through hole. The board can be ordered at any of your prefered manufacturers for cheap, or can be implemented on perfboard or even mounted on a protoboard (though I cannot recommend this last option).

The board is designed to be mounted behind the E-ink screen and can be held up with M3 nylon stands (though as the board is narrower than the screen, only the rightmost ones will support the board).

## WROOM Board

* [Schematics](WROOM%20Board/Schematics.pdf)

* [Changelog](WROOM%20Board/CHANGELOG.md)

The WROOM board is designed to be a better looking, integrated version of the Shield board. Functionally they are comparable.

The board is the same size of the e-ink module and is designed to be mounted either using M3 Standoffs, though a 3D printed "sandwich" piece is available on the "/Models" folder, that fits better and has openings for the usual expansions.

The board can be mounted with all components facing forward or with the components hidden behind the screen. The first is easier for hacking and developing, the second is visually more appealing.
